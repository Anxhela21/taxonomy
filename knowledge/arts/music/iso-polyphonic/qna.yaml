  - context: >-
      Iso-Polyphony is a traditional part of Albanian folk music. It's included
      in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Albanian Iso-Polyphony is
      considered to have its roots in the many-voiced vajtim, the southern
      Albanian traditional lamentation of the dead. The instrumental expression
      of Albanian Iso-Polyphony evolved into the Albanian kaba.

      - question: Where is Iso-Polyphony listed?
        answer: UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List
      - question: What is vajtim?
        answer: Southern Albanian lament for the dead
      - question: What expresses Iso-Polyphony?
        answer: Kaba
  - context: >-
      Albanian Iso-Polyphony is believed to originate from the many-voiced vajtim,
      the southern Albanian traditional lamentation of the dead. Scholars studying
      Albanian iso-polyphony and Balkan polyphonic music generally consider it an ancient
      tradition dating back to the Thraco-Illyrian era. Although historical documentation
      is scarce, the tradition has been preserved through oral transmission across
      generations. Specific features such as the pentatonic modal structure,
      recitative vocals, calls and shouts, and a cappella singing suggest an ancient origin.

      - question: What era is Iso-Polyphony from?
        answer: Thraco-Illyrian era
      - question: How has it been preserved?
        answer: Oral transmission
      - question: What vocals are used?
        answer: Recitative, calls, shouts, a cappella

      Despite the region being under Byzantine rule for centuries, Balkan polyphonic
      traditional music developed differently from medieval Byzantine music.
      The Balkan tradition remained non-institutionalized and collectively formed,
      while Byzantine music was created by individual composers and institutionalized.
      Although the two traditions coexisted and likely influenced each other,
      the interaction between Albanian polyphonic traditional music and Byzantine
      music is considered relatively minor.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How long were the Balkans under Byzantine rule?
        answer: Centuries
      - question: How is Balkan polyphonic music different from Byzantine?
        answer: Non-institutional, collective
      - question: Did the two influence each other?
        answer: Minimal interaction

      Albanian polyphonic traditional music is thought to have initially consisted
      of two melodic lines: the taker (first voice) and the turner (second voice).
      The turner likely played a non-specific melodic role, a style still found in
      the two-voiced polyphonic singing of women in Gjirokastër. Over time, the turner
      became more precisely defined melodically, a tradition now seen among the men
      of Dukat. Two-voice iso-polyphony is also present in various regions of Albania,
      including Korcë, Librazhd, Pogradec, Kolonjë, Fier, Shpat i Sipërm of Elbasan,
      Myzeqe, Vlorë, Berat, Mallakastër, Gjirokastër, Lunxhëri, as well as in
      Albanian-speaking areas of Zajas, Kičevo, and Tetovo. Additionally,
      it is found among the Arbëreshë of Calabria. Scholar Vasil Tole argues
      that two-voice polyphony should not be seen merely as an initial stage
      but rather as a "hidden" form of three-voice polyphony.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What role did the turner play?
        answer: Non-specific melodic role
      - question: How did the turner role evolve?
        answer: Became more precisely defined melodically
      - question: Where is two-voiced iso-polyphony found?
        answer: In various regions of Albania

      The next development in Albanian traditional polyphony was the introduction
      of the drone (iso), which complemented the existing melodic lines and led
      to three-voiced polyphony. This addition enriched the harmonic interplay
      between melodic lines and became a common feature in modern Albanian polyphonic
      tradition. While traditionally sung only by men, three-voice iso-polyphony
      is now performed by mixed-gender groups in regions such as Skrapar, Gramsh,
      Devoll, Gjirokastër, Kolonjë, Sarandë, and Vlorë.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What led to the three-voiced polyphony?
        answer: The drone (iso)
      - question: How did the drone affect polyphony?
        answer: Enriched the harmonic interplay
      - question: Who sung three-voiced iso-polyphony?
        answer: Traditionally men, now mixed-gender groups
